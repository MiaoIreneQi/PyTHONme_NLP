# PyTHONme_NLP
Welcome to the project of PyTHONme. We're Stepahine, Irene, Bruce and Daivd.
This project is for the group project requirement of the course FINA 4350, Fall 20-21, at HKU.
In this project, we aimed to find the connection between President Trump's remarks and the stock market.
You may have seen a finalized python file and data sources either in csv or excel format.
The component_code folder contains the codes that comprise the finalized python file.
If you want to run the code, download this repository as a zip file, extract the folder, and run the finalized python file in that folder.
Note that this code will take roughly 15 minutes to run.
Suggestions for improvement are welcomed.
